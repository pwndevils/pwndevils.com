New to CTFs and computer security in general? No problem, the pwndevils got you covered (we were all curious newbies at one point)!

Most of the CTF challenges require a Linux machine (installing Ubuntu 16.04 or the latest LTS in a virtual machine is pretty easy), as most of the binaries in most of the competitions run on Linux.

A lot of our recent challenges run best on [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) so we recommend installing that as well.

Also great is to work your way through the [OverTheWire war-games:](http://overthewire.org/wargames/) Bandit is the game that's targeted towards beginners, and it helps you get familiar with linux environments. The other games are great, and get more and more difficult (in a good way).

We've been collecting/creating a set of CTF challenges, as well as custom challenges, that run on docker at [https://github.com/adamdoupe/ctf-training](https://github.com/adamdoupe/ctf-training).

For web hacking, [Google has a good practice/testing web application](https://google-gruyere.appspot.com/).
